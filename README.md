# traficar-promocode-sender
Automated check of @traficar_pl account on the instagram and sending me an sms with the promo code. I wan't to minimise time spent on the Social Media and pay less for carsharing.

EDIT: 1.12.23 - Doesn't work anymore because Instagram doesn't show description of the posts if you open a profile. You have to <b><i>log in </i></b>, select a photo and then download a description.
    That disables me from this, because I log in via FB, and have 2FA at FB. :(
